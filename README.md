*DESCRIPTION*:As part of a UI/UX Design task, I was assigned to design a fully responsive webpage that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The task emphasized the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a layout that is not only visually appealing but also functional and responsive. The goal was to demonstrate an understanding of responsive web design principles, effective layout structuring, interactive elements, and adaptive styling techniques.

To approach this, I first conceptualized the purpose and theme of the website. I decided to create a brand-themed landing page called "Artful Alchemy", which would reflect creativity, design transformation, and visual elegance. The structure of the webpage included key components: a navigation header, a hero section, a feature offerings section, and a footer.

In terms of design system, I chose a subtle and elegant color palette. The primary color was a soft light olive green, complemented by beige and creme shades. These colors were chosen to give a calm, sophisticated, and modern visual feel. The typography featured the Georgia font for headings and brand identity, adding a classic and refined touch.

Header & Navigation
The navigation bar was designed to include the site name, “Artful Alchemy,” and standard navigation links like Home, Features, Gallery, and Contact. I styled the navbar with a darker shade of olive green to provide contrast against the page background. The links were styled in beige, and a hover effect was added to change them to white, enhancing interactivity. For mobile responsiveness, I implemented a hamburger menu using JavaScript that toggles the navigation links, ensuring smooth usability on smaller devices.

Hero Section
The hero section features a bold heading: “Experience the Power of Design”, displayed in dark olive green on a beige background, with a focus on strong typography and visual hierarchy. A supporting paragraph follows, also styled in dark olive green, reinforcing the message. A prominent “Get Started” button is placed below, styled in dark olive green with beige text to maintain color consistency and encourage user interaction.

Features Section
Next, I created the "What We Offer" section, consisting of three feature cards: Clean UI, Mobile Ready, and Interactive. These cards are styled uniformly in beige text with hover animations that add depth and engagement without overwhelming the user. The section heading was also rendered in Georgia font for brand consistency. I ensured that this section preserved the subtle animations originally implemented, using transitions and JavaScript for an enhanced user experience.

Footer
For the footer, I used a beige background and added a simple message: “Artful Alchemy – All Right Reserved.” The text was styled in olive green to stay consistent with the site’s overall color theme. I also added social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn) using Font Awesome to enhance connectivity and provide a modern, complete finish.

Responsiveness
To fulfill the primary requirement of responsive design, I used CSS Flexbox, media queries, and percentage-based widths to ensure that every component — the header, hero section, feature grid, and footer — adapts gracefully to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, elements stack vertically, fonts scale proportionally, and padding adjusts to provide a clutter-free experience.

JavaScript Interactivity
JavaScript was used primarily for the mobile menu toggle, making the navigation links appear/disappear when the hamburger icon is clicked. This script enhances usability on devices with limited screen space and aligns with the project’s responsive goals.

Hosting the Project
To make the project accessible online, I hosted it using GitHub Pages. I created a public repository, pushed the source code, and enabled GitHub Pages through the repository settings. Once activated, a live link was generated, allowing anyone to visit and interact with the responsive website in real-time.
